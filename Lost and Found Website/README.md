Project with Partner (cowrote code)

About: This is a lost-and-found website for UC Davis students using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This was our final project requiring us to integrate a 3rd party service (in our case Google Maps) as well as design our own server response handling through Glitch. We also used SQL database requests for item search functionality. The website allows a user to post/search as a seeker (a user looking for an item) or as a finder (a user who has found an item). The website only allows for UCDavis domain emails to log in through Google OAuth (I included screenshots to get a basic sense of functionality). This code is not optimal and I struggled with wanting code that was functional (the end product) and something that was more elegant in its design. This was a holistic look at web development and helped me understand the basics of server work and develop client/server game functionality when working at EA in 2020.
