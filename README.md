This code sample portfolio is a compilation of 4 different projects I have worked on with code samples that I wrote or cowrote on a team. Each project utilizes different languages and skills and are summarized in their README.txt. Unfortunately, access to Unity files (like for my game "New Leaf") are stored on school computers that I no longer have access to. My work done at EA is also under a NDA/company policy so I can discuss some of the things I learned but cannot represent that here in code sample form. However, I feel that these projects are representative of my coding ability and appreciate your time!

Sincerely,
Grace Willhoite
