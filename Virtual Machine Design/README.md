File: VirtualMachine.cpp

About: VirtualMachine.cpp is a 10 week long cumulative assignment designing and implementing operating system process threading, general file reading/accessing with mutexes, and FAT16 file system mounting in C++ for a virtual machine interface. The virtual machine was meant to fit a machine designed by my professor (not included here). The comments/logic are messier than my usual coding style but the scope and difficulty for this particular assignment was one of my most challenging and rewarding projects. The professor did not lecture for this course, and I ended up learning on my own to understand the concepts behind creating a Virtual Machine interface. I am incredibly proud of this project for my tenacity, my ability to ask for help from others, and that I was able to accomplish such an ambitious project in 10 weeks.
