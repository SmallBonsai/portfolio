Project with Partner (cowrote code)

About: These code samples are the implementations of a map, multimap and set using a self-balancing red-black tree algorithm. Insertion, deletion and searching is guaranteed to be O(logn) with this algorithm. This was one of my first group projects and was foundational for understanding good code style/functionality and recursion.
